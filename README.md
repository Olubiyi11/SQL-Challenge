# SQL-Challenge
UC Berkley Visual Analytics Bootcamp Module 9 assignment
I made my own ERD which I thought was ok, but I got help from one of the tutors, Sandyah Kumar, who suggested other ideas about how the tables could be joined. The schema was exported,but the whole thing would not run if I highlight and run entire code, but it ran successfully when I ran the querry for each table separately.The tables were there, the columns as well, but when I tried to view each table with the querry SELECT * FROM <table name>, two of the tables could't be viewed. I sought help from ASKBCS, and found out that I had title_no as INT in some places and as VARCHAR in another. I imported the csv for each table. Finally, although I pretty much had it all figured out, I got help from Saad Khan completing the querries. My best work in my opinion so far.
